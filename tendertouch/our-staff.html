She was awarded the “Super Vet” award in 2009, by supervets.org which is a listing of outstanding veterinarians who love animals.
Dr. Sadhanala is compassionate about providing the best care, not only for her four-legged patients but also to better serve their human companions as well! Along with traditional and modern medicine, she has strong interest in Acupuncture, Nutrition and Neutraceuticals.
She is a Certified Veterinary Acupuncturist from the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society (IVAS).
Her special interest lies in integrative medicine and multi-modal approach to patient care so as to provide the best quality of care. Her interests include client education, ultrasound and internal medicine.
